`text-diff` can be used to compare two text files and output the difference between them. `text-diff` was written in `Rust` and offers a simple and intuitive user-interface for Windows, Linux and macOS.

## Building

In order to build `text-diff`, you can run the following command:

```shell
cargo build
```

A `release` build with extra optimizations can be built by issuing the following command:
```shell
cargo build --release
```

### Tips

On `Linux` you can further decrease the binary size by issuing a `strip` command, which will 'strip' symbols from the object file:
```shell
strip filename
```

## Running

You can run `text-diff` directly by issuing the following command:
```shell
cargo run
```
