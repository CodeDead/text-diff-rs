`text-diff` can be used to compare two text files and output the difference between them. `text-diff` was written
in `Rust` and offers a simple and intuitive user-interface for Windows, Linux and macOS.

## Features

* Compare two text files
* Display the differences between two text files
* Export the differences to TXT, CSV or JSON
* Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* Cross-platform
* Fully native binaries

## Building

In order to build `text-diff`, you can run the following command:

```shell
cargo build
```

A `release` build with extra optimizations can be built by issuing the following command:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

### Tips

On `Linux` you can further decrease the binary size by issuing a `strip` command, which will 'strip' symbols from the
object file, after building:

```shell
cargo build --release && strip target/release/text-diff
```

## Running

You can run `text-diff` directly by issuing the following command:

```shell
cargo run
```
